        How closely related are learning media to learning disabilities? Are different learning media able to
        accommodate different learning disabilities?
    </p>
    <hr style="border-top: 1px dotted">
    <p>I recently rewatched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taare_Zameen_Par">Taare Zameen
            Par</a>, a Bollywood movie about a child with dyslexia and other
        learning disabilities. The movie portrays the child’s struggles trying
        to understand English: letters float around the screen, jumble amongst
        themselves, and even spawn into spiders. Interestingly, the Hindi
        alphabet wasn’t visualized in the same way.<br />

            <p class="image-caption">Floating letters from Taare Zameen Par</p>
        </center>
    </p>
    <p>Initially this made sense, since Hindi has a far larger alphabet and
        is phonetically closer to spoken language than English. But as I thought
        about it more, I wondered if the different properties of the language
        affected learning disabilities. Would a child with dyslexia have the
        same problems with Hindi as they would with English? Taking this one
        step further, what is the relationship between the learning media and
        different learning disabilities?</p>
    <p>For example, is dyslexia more or less prevalent in languages that
        don’t use the Latin alphabet? Would mathematics be simpler to learn and
        understand if we used a different base or notation system? Would
        programming be easier to pick up if the semantics were closer to natural
        language, or even a different medium?</p>
    <p>I’m no expert in any of these fields, but I think it’s a fun exercise
        to think about.

    </center>
    <p>Some low-hanging fruit is leveraging embeddings or LLMs to
        interpolate between representations of different media. For example,
        interpolating an English statement with a mathematical statement, or
        interpolating between natural language and a programming language.
        Training embeddings is fairly inexpensive (depending on the GPU, &lt;$1
        hour for 1 billion tokens), while LLMs are good at translating between
        different topics and pattern matching of “learned” things. Automating
        these flows with self-serve tools can lower the barrier for everyone to
        discover the best learning media for them.
