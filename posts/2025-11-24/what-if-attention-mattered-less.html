    <p>The attenion market has been discussed more and more over the last
decade. I recently read <a
href="https://www.yesigiveafig.com/p/part-1-my-life-is-a-lie">this
Substack</a> and revisited <a
href="https://maanav.writeas.com/attention-is-an-inefficient-market">this
piece</a> by Maanav and it had me wondering: how would the world be
different if attention was not as highly valued as it is today?</p>
<p>The internet would be a very different place. “Scrollable” social
media video platforms maximize your scrolling and your time spent on the
app. Ad platforms operate similarly. If we devalued attention, I think
the internet would become… a lot less altruistic. The internet is free
today because we pay with our attention, our data. This was PageRank’s
second order effect: user reveal preferences through clicks, which lead
to better ads. With “devalued” attention, companies providing services
still need to monetize. Subscriptions would likely fill this gap, as is
the norm with Substack, online newspapers, and streaming services. Users
would need to directly pay to indicate what they care about. As these
industries mature, they’ll likely lead to oligopolies, which is what
we’ve seen with streaming platforms.</p>
<p>What about the “physical” world? Putting aside the obvious candidates
of billboards and TV ads, what happens to the physical things we
interact with?</p>
<p>Let’s start with personal computing. Our phones are designed to align
with what users want more, which tends towards apps that retain
attention: social media, video games, etc. When we cared less about this
ephemeral attention, phones were much more utilitarian, AKA traditional
flip phones. Users often valued “exotic” features more and combining
utilities into 1 device. Today, those features are intended to be a
“cherry on top” to push users over the edge.</p>
<p>Laptops, despite their utilitarian nature, have also trended towards
more attention-grabbing feature sets. But if we didn’t care as much
about watching streaming services on our devices geared towards
individual preferences, we probably would have very different designs.
E-ink screens could be the norm for reading and ease on the eyes.
Tactile features such as keyboards and phyiscal buttons might be more
relevant. It’s also possible that server-side computing would be more
relevant with centralized compute and light-weight client devices that
are optimized for specific use-cases only.</p>
<p>The retail industry and physical stores would also be very different.
Today’s shift towards online shopping would be thwarted and focus more
on in-person experiences. Stores would likely instead optimize for
efficiency and utility rather than creating trends that capture online
attention.</p>
<p>I think the world would become more collective rather than personal.
Without the incentive to cater to individual attention, people
themselves would likely value community more. Does that mean attention
is overvalued? Maybe. Will it ever truly matter less? I don’t know. It
might with enough time go back to some “equilibrium”. But until then
it’s fun to consider the alternatives.</p>
