## Unstructured Exploration is All You Need

A little less than a month ago I graduated from college. My college experience was, well, unplanned in various ways. I never expected to have a freshman year plagued with COVID, graduate a year early, come back for a one year Master's, or spend time on the things I care about most deeply in college. 

But that's kind of how I designed my college experience. 

When I graduated high school, I wanted my college experience to be unstructured in the way I spend my time outside of classes. I made a robust, researched plan for my classes (classic freshman move lol) but I didn't know what I want to do with my time outside. I learned the most when I did things outside of class in high school, but Berkeley was so big and had so many things to do. Other nuances of Berkeley include the club/professional org culture, but we won't dive into that much. 

The best way for me to figure out what I wanted to do was to try doing many things. Not in a spray-and-pray way, but by trying to disciplined dives into different things. I wouldn't quite call it research since I was mostly ingesting information and trying to understand different things by working out quirks or nuances in concepts in code or writing. I tried to explore different things from machine learning to programming languages to security, but this wasn't satisfying. I wanted, even needed, a community of people that had approximately the same directions or interests to start concretizing the random things I was reading or learning.

I was fortunate enough to find varous communities in college that contributed to this. These communities were *everything*: friends, roommates, research colleagues, study buddies, you name it. They were the people that I could talk about anything happening in my life, things I cared about, things I wanted to do, and everything in between.

As I inched closer to graduation, I felt something different. In fact, it felt like I felt nothing. Every senior photoshoot, every final project, every "last something" event was supposed to make graduation feel real, but it just didn't. Even walking up to Memorial Stadium for commencement or flipping the tassel just felt like a normal day. There's the classic joke of "you don't real college ends on a random Wednesday", but that really is true. But why was this different?

## Post-College is like... the Pandemic?
