# Unstructured Exploration is All You Need (ðŸš§ wip ðŸš§)

A little less than a month ago I graduated from college. My college experience was, well, unplanned in various ways. I never expected to have a freshman year plagued with COVID, graduate a year early, come back for a one year Master's, or spend time on the things I care about most deeply in college. 

But that's kind of how I designed my college experience. 

When I graduated high school, I wanted my college experience to be unstructured in the way I spend my time outside of classes. I made a robust, researched plan for my classes (classic freshman move lol) but I didn't know what I want to do with my time outside. I learned the most when I did things outside of class in high school, but Berkeley was so big and had so many things to do. Other nuances of Berkeley include the club/professional org culture, but we won't dive into that much. 

The best way for me to figure out what I wanted to do was to try doing many things. Not in a spray-and-pray way, but by trying to disciplined dives into different things. I wouldn't quite call it research since I was mostly ingesting information and trying to understand different things by working out quirks or nuances in concepts in code or writing. I tried to explore different things from machine learning to programming languages to security, but this wasn't satisfying. I wanted, even needed, a community of people that had approximately the same directions or interests to start concretizing the random things I was reading or learning.

I was fortunate enough to find varous communities in college that contributed to this. These communities were *everything*: friends, roommates, research colleagues, study buddies, you name it. They were the people that I could talk about anything happening in my life, things I cared about, things I wanted to do
