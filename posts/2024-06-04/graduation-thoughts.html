       miscellaneous yapping about graduation split up into different realizations

<h2 id="unstructured-exploration-is-all-you-need">Unstructured
Exploration is All You Need</h2>
<p>A little less than a month ago I graduated from college. My college
experience was, well, unplanned in various ways. I never expected to
have a freshman year plagued with COVID, graduate a year early, come
back for a one year Master’s, or spend time on the things I care about
most deeply in college.</p>
<p>But that’s kind of how I designed my college experience.</p>
<p>When I graduated high school, I wanted my college experience to be
unstructured in the way I spend my time outside of classes. I made a
robust, researched plan for my classes (classic freshman move lol) but I
didn’t know what I want to do with my time outside. I learned the most
when I did things outside of class in high school, but Berkeley was so
big and had so many things to do. Other nuances of Berkeley include the
club/professional org culture, but we won’t dive into that much.</p>
<p>The best way for me to figure out what I wanted to do was to try
doing many things. Not in a spray-and-pray way, but by trying to
disciplined dives into different things. I wouldn’t quite call it
research since I was mostly ingesting information and trying to
understand different things by working out quirks or nuances in concepts
in code or writing. I tried to explore different things from machine
learning to programming languages to security, but this wasn’t
satisfying. I wanted, even needed, a community of people that had
approximately the same directions or interests to start concretizing the
random things I was reading or learning.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to find varous communities in college that
contributed to this. These communities were <em>everything</em>:
friends, roommates, research colleagues, study buddies, you name it.
They were the people that I could talk about anything happening in my
life, things I cared about, things I wanted to do, and everything in
between.</p>
<p>As I inched closer to graduation, I felt something different. In
fact, it felt like I felt nothing. Every senior photoshoot, every final
project, every “last something” event was supposed to make graduation
feel real, but it just didn’t. Even walking up to Memorial Stadium for
commencement or flipping the tassel just felt like a normal day. There’s
the classic joke of “you don’t real college ends on a random Wednesday”,
but that really is true. But why was this different?</p>
