# Patagonia: Wind and Silence

Torres del Paine is as dramatic as the photographs suggest, but no image captures the scale or the wind.

## The W Trek

Five days on the trail. The weather changed constantly—sun, rain, sleet, back to sun within a single hour. The refugios along the route are surprisingly comfortable.

**Day 3** was the highlight: the base of the towers at sunrise. Started hiking at 4am in complete darkness. Reached the viewpoint just as the first light hit the granite spires.

## What Surprised Me

The quiet. Once you get past the first few kilometers, the trail empties out. Entire afternoons passed without seeing another person.

The expense. Patagonia is not a budget destination. Worth planning and saving for.
