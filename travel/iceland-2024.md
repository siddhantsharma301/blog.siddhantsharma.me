# The Ring Road

Eight days driving around Iceland's Route 1. The landscape changes every hour—volcanic fields give way to glaciers give way to green valleys.

## Highlights

**Jökulsárlón**: The glacier lagoon at sunset. Icebergs drift silently toward the sea. Seals pop up between the ice.

**Westfjords detour**: Added three days to the trip. Worth every minute. The roads are rough but the isolation is complete.

**Reykjavik**: Spent too little time here. The city has excellent bookshops and the hot dog stand lives up to the hype.

## Practical Notes

- Fill up on gas whenever you see a station. Distances between them can be surprising.
- The wind is relentless. Budget extra time for everything.
- August means midnight sun. Blackout curtains in accommodations are essential.
