# Kyoto in December

The light in Kyoto at dusk has a particular quality—soft, golden, filtered through the last remaining maple leaves.

## Fushimi Inari at Dawn

Woke up at 5am to beat the crowds at Fushimi Inari. The thousands of vermillion torii gates were almost empty, save for a few other early risers and the occasional cat. The higher you climb, the more the city reveals itself below.

## Notes on Food

- **Nishiki Market**: The pickles here are exceptional. Bought too many to carry.
- **A small udon shop** near Kiyomizu-dera: The owner has been making udon for 40 years. No English menu. Point at what looks good.

## What I'd Do Differently

Spend less time in the tourist centers, more time in the northern districts. Arashiyama is beautiful but crowded even in December.
